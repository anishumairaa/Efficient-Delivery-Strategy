# PosLaju Delivery Strategy
## Transforming Delivery Efficiency Through Data-Driven Innovation

## Overview
PosLaju Delivery Strategy is a CSC4202 2025 Group 9 project that leverages algorithm analysis to optimize delivery operations.

## Problem statement

How can Pak Cik Adam delivery from Serdang hub to multiple destinations efficiently?

Pak Cik Adam
- has insufficient money to refuel the truck
- wants the highest payback

Poslaju delivery man wants to minimize the total distance traveled  to deliver parcels while also maximizing the profit earned from each delivery.

## Objective

To determine the most efficient algorithm for optimizing parcel delivery, considering both profit maximization and route minimization under truck capacity constraints.

1. Analyze delivery data

2. Develop predictive models

3. Make informed decisions to improve efficiency and reduce costs


## üìä Performance Evaluation Objectives

This project aims to identify the most efficient algorithm for delivery route optimization based on the following key metrics:

- üí∞ **Total Profit Achieved**  
  Measure the profitability of each route by maximizing deliveries with the highest returns.

- üìè **Total Distance Traveled**  
  Evaluate which algorithm produces the shortest path to reduce fuel costs and time.

- ‚è±Ô∏è **Total Execution Time**  
  Compare the computational efficiency of each algorithm to ensure scalability in real-time systems.

- üó∫Ô∏è **Route Identification**  
  Determine the optimal delivery route starting from **Serdang**, covering multiple destinations effectively.
